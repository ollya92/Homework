1. Run the module `modules/mod_a.py`. Check its result. Explain why does this happen.
Output: 5.
We import mod_c and mod_b, so we have access to attributes of this modules.
2. Try to change x to a list `[1,2,3]`. Explain the result.
Output:5.
In mod_a we import both modules- mod_c, mod_b. So, if we change a value of "x" in mod_c,
    before print this value in mod_a we change it in mod_b. In mod_c we have mutable value. If we want to modify it we should type in mod_b, for example,
	mod_c.x[1]=5. If we do it we receive as the result [1, 5, 3]. In our case, we change x from mutable(list) to immutable(int).
3. Operator `from` copy names, not referenses. So, if we try to print(x) we receive a value of x from mod_c. 
If we try print(mod_c.x) we receive a value of x from mod_b.
